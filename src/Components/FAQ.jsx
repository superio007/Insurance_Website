                </p>
                <h1>What is a ‘Deductible’?</h1>
                <p>Deductible is among the clauses an insurance company uses as a threshold for the policy payment for travel or health insurance. It is a decided amount that you must pay from your pocket when you claim the insurance. For example, if the deductible is INR 25,000 and you have insurance coverage of INR 1,00,000, you would have to pay INR 25,000 out of your pocket and the insurance company will cover the rest of the INR 75,000. </p>
                <h1>What is a No-Claim Bonus?</h1>
                <p>No-claim bonus refers to a benefit insurance companies offer to those who haven’t claimed insurance during the preceding year of cover. It lowers the premium for the following year. </p>
                <h1>What do you Mean by Co-Insurance?</h1>
                <p>Co-insurance is a policy usually offered by health insurance companies. In this policy, you share the coverage with the insurance policy in a percentage of the policy value after the deductible. Usually, the split is 80%/20% where the policyholder has to pay 20% while the insurance company pays the 80% of the covered amount.
                Suppose you have claimed health insurance for INR 20,000 and it requires a deductible of INR 10,000. After paying the deduction, the remaining amount is INR 10,000 and the co-insurance is 80/20. Now you’d have to pay INR 2,000 out of your pocket and insurance will pay INR 8,000. 
                </p>
                <h1>What is a Loss payee?</h1>
                <p>Loss payee is an institution or person that receives the insurance payment for the loss of a vehicle or property you own. In the event of payment being made under the policy in relation to the insured, it would go to the third party rather than to the beneficiary of the same. For example, if you had auto insurance of a car you bought on loan and the car crashed within the loan’s payment duration, the money would go to the lender rather than you. </p>
                <h1>What do you Mean by Surrender Value?</h1>
                <p>Surrender value, also known as cash value or cash surrender value is the monetary amount the policyholder gets from the life insurance company if they decide to exit the same before it reaches the maturity date. A common premium policy would acquire surrender value if the policyholder has paid its premium for three years continually. The policy ceases as soon as the policyholder withdraws the amount and they might lose all the returns on the policy. </p>
                <h1>How do you Claim an Insurance policy?</h1>
                <p>To claim an insurance policy, you first have to fill up the claim form and contact the financial advisor from whom you purchased the policy. After completing these steps, you have to provide the required documents such as the payment receipt. When everything is verified and deemed fine, you would get your insurance claim within seven days of your claiming date. </p>
                <h1>What do you Mean by paid Value?</h1>
                <p>The paid value is the reduced assured amount the insurance company pays if the policyholder stops paying premiums after a specific duration. In simple terms, when a person stops paying premiums after a specific duration, the policy remains but with a lower assured amount, this low amount is called paid value or paid-up value.
                The amount the insurance company assures to pay reduces if the person claims the paid-up value. The reduction depends on how soon before the maturity period has the person requested the paid value.
                </p>
                <h1>What Happens If a person Doesn’t pay premium payments?</h1>
                <p>In normal cases, if a person stops paying premiums, the insurance company gives them 10-15 days as a grace period after the due date. However, if the person doesn’t pay even in the grace period, their policy lapses. After that duration, the person would have to pay the due premium along with interest charged on the premium since the due date to revive the policy. 
                On the other hand, if the person paid premium payments for a substantial duration (2-3 years minimum) and then they stop paying the premium, the Insurance company will deduct the premium from the accumulated sum. This is particularly common with permanent life insurance policies. It continues until the accumulated funds deplete after which the company terminates the policy.
